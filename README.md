## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 7,617 unique crime articles (2005â€“2022) using Python to uncover temporal, categorical, and geographic trends in crime reporting. The analysis leverages data manipulation, visualization, natural language processing (NLP), and an interactive search interface to provide actionable insights into crime patterns. Key objectives include identifying peak crime reporting periods, dominant crime categories, and primary news sources, while enabling users to explore articles interactively.
